1: create the turn system
D   - set monster max health, mind, and visible status on load
D   - partial movement per player turn, use leftover
D       - issue on turnover for zargon.
    - replace player movement wth custom speeds.
D       - pre-define race/class of each player - presets down the list
D        - pre-calculate speed, body, mind, of each player.
D            - set stepsRemain too.
D        - apply base speed for each member in procs
     - hide coloring on click level, except on attack, move, spell/ability
D       - always show eligible spots on movement, other characters are not eligible spot
            - after moving a character from a spot, revert the spot to previous status. (not just 0) use a refresh function for imap
            - instead of setting monsters and players on the map, check them programattically.
        - only show red on creatures that are in attack range
    - add other player actions, attack, spell, skill 
    - switching to other action ends movement
    - set door open on moving into a room
    - monster movement
    - monster actions spell, attack
    - monster inactive when invisible
    - on door, option to "open door" on sidebar
    - check for obstructions for creatures in attack range.

Ideas:
Monsters can have low or high defence, based on type. 
could also be monsters just use shields too. 
black shields become fails. 
    fails calculated as shields rolled - black shields rolled, if <1 take a damage. weapons take 1 dmg/round max.
